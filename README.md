# Robot_Localization
In this Repository there are three python files : 1. Robot sense localization.py: The sense function exists in this file determine or returns the probability of each location in the grid according to two input (current Probability , Input measures from sensors).
2. Move Function.py : The move function exists in this file returns the probability of each location in the grid after moving of robot no. of given steps taking in case the probability may overshoot or undershoot the target.
3.And Finally last file combines between theese two functions move and sense but this time with multiple inputs from sensors and multiple moves and returns the pobability of locations after that
